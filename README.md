# txt2voice
**VERY EARLY VERSION, USE AT YOUR OWN PERIL**

by Tim Gore, KE6QBV  

**ABOUT**  

*t2vGUI* is based on my earlier program, *txt2voice*. It's a small python program to create channel announcement voice files for use with Motorola two-way radios.  

The WAV files created by this program are compatible with Motorola MotoTrbo XPR, XTS-5000 and APX series radios. It may work with more radio models, however these are the radios I own and have personally tested for compatibility.  

**REQUIREMENTS**  

The only requirements outside of python libraries is ffmpeg. On Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint based systems, the following command will install this requirement:  

`sudo apt install ffmpeg`  

The python libraries required are *gtts* and *PySimpleGUI*. Those can be installed PIP as follows:  

`pip install gtts`  

`pip install PySimpleGUI`
